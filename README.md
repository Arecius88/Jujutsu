# Jujutsu

A program to choose, at random, technics in jujustu Kai system for 1 dan. 
Right now it's only for Kihon for 1 dan. 

Plan for this project is:
  Have a countdown on the amount of technics that are left in a family. 
  Make it possible to change kyu-grade and only get that kyu-grade Kihon.
  Make it possible to choose if the user wants the technics in order or at random. 
  Include Classes in the code that is not a part of Kivy. 


  Stretchgoals: 
    Include the Jigo wasa for all kyu and dan-grades
    include the Renraku Wasa for all kyu and dan-grades
    Make a counter that count how many times a User have completed a technocfamily
      Kihon = +1 on all sub Kihon groups. 
    
  Have different users that indivudally can track the above
  Present the data in a cool fashion
  

DONE: 
Make a GUI - Done
